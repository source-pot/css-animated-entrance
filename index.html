                    Hi, my name's Rob and I've spent many years learning out how to program
                    on the web.  In my toolkit I have many server-side languages like PHP, Perl,
                    and Ruby, many front-end languages like Javascript and it's friends: Typescript
                    and CoffeeScript, and many compiled languages like C++, Java, and Rust.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over time, this website will serve as an output of my playtime and somewhere
                    I can demonstrate my craft.  I'll include snippets of code including
                    explanations of the what and how and probably ramblings around new concepts I
                    pick up.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section__heading">Animated intro on this site</h2>
                <p>
                    You may have noticed when you arrived here that there's a little welcome message
                    on the website before you get to this main content.  It's created in CSS with a
                    tiny sprinkle of javascript to control it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="/css/anim-intro.css" target="_blank">Here's the CSS involved
                    in this animated intro</a> and <a href="/js/anim-intro.js" target="_blank">here's
                    the Javascript</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's neither big nor clever, but it entertained me
                    to create it. To trigger the animation, a bit of Javascript is required to
                    remove the "preview mode" class and add the main class:
                    <code>document.body.classList.replace('page--preview-active', 'page')</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only part of this I'm not a fan of is the need to keep the vertical
                    scrollbar visible when in "preview mode".  I couldn't figure out a way to not
                    have the content "jump" to the left when the scrollbar appears as the main site
                    content appears.
                </p>
