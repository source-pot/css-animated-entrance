                    Hi, my name's Rob and I've spent many years learning about how to program
                    on the web.  In my toolkit I have many server-side languages like PHP, Perl,
                    and Ruby, many front-end languages like Javascript and it's friends: Typescript
                    and CoffeeScript, and many compiled languages like C++, Java, and Rust.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over time, this website will serve as an output of my playtime and somewhere
                    I can demonstrate my craft.  I'll include snippets of code including
                    explanations of the what and how and probably ramblings around new concepts I
                    pick up.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You may have noticed when you arrived here that there's a little welcome message
                    on the website before you get to this main content.  It's created in CSS with a
                    tiny sprinkle of javascript to control it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://github.com/source-pot/animated-entrance" target="_blank">All
                    the code for this website is on Github</a>.  I'll be updating the readme file in
                    due course with some extra notes on what to look out for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's neither big nor clever, but it entertained me to create it. To trigger the
                    animation, a bit of Javascript is required to remove the "preview mode" class
                    and add the main class, but the rest of it is all vanilla CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only part of this I'm not a fan of is the need to keep the vertical
                    scrollbar visible when in "preview mode".  I couldn't figure out a way to not
                    have the content "jump" to the left when the scrollbar appears as the main site
                    content appears.

                <blockquote>
                    BEM - Block Element Modifier - is a methodology that helps you to create
                    reusable components and code sharing in front-end development
                </blockquote>

                    So when trying out this new website look, I wondered if there was an accepted
                    way to name classes and IDs of elements to target them with CSS.  I found BEM.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As noted above, all the code is on the
                    <a href="https://github.com/source-pot/animated-entrance" target="_blank">Github
                    </a> so you can take a look there, or just inspect this page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While I'm not sure if I'm totally onboard with BEM, I've tried it out here and
                    I can see some clear benefits.  Not having to figure out specificity of elements
                    when applying styles is a big win, it allows the CSS to be split up then
                    recompiled later without fear of the the styles being in the wrong order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have applied my own little spin on BEM on this page: I've fallen back on the
                    old "global reset" and "text modifiers" for a few things (see
                    <code>.text--small</code>).  I also do prefer to have a base set of styles for
                    the page then build upon that with classes, so I do style specific tags still.
                    It's definitely an idea for naming that feels good to me.
